# ParaHAT: A Fast Noisy Long Read Alignment Tool with Multi-Level Parallelism

## Introduction

The birth of SMRT technology has resolved many limitations of second-generation sequencing, but it has also brought about an exponential increase in alignment data, as well as a higher error rate in sequencing. ParaHAT is a noise long-read alignment tool that employs multi-level parallel technology. It fully utilizes vector-level, thread-level, process-level, and heterogeneous parallelism to accelerate noise long-read alignment.
